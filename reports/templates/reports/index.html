<b>Welcome to the SPT Report System Beta!</b>
</br></br>

This system is designed to help make writing reports quicker and easier. We are in a beta phase for the report generator and the software is still being developed. Your feedback and suggestions will be used to build the next version!
Drop me a line at jsudlow@gmail.com to tell me how to improve the system so it can be the best it can be.

<b>How to write a new report</b> </br>
<br />
1) Login. If you do not have a login or forgot your password call Jon. His number can be found with the office manager. You can email if you wish at jsudlow@gmail.com</br>
2) After you login select the report you are trying to write. For now you should just select speech evaluation reports</br>
3) In the upper right hand corner click add speech evaluation report</br>
</br>
<i>Now you are in the report edit window</i>
</br></br>
1) Choose the patient the report is for. If the patient is not listed you can add their details using the plus button to the right of the patient drop down menu. If a field does not apply to the patient add a "-" character</br>
2) Choose the location therapy was done. Which location you choose decides which address to print on the final report</br>
3) Choose the type of report. This can be for initials or progress reports<br />
4) Choose date of visit and diagnosis<br />
5) The big text boxes have controls like MS word. You can high light text and click
B for bold and I for italics. Numbered and bullet lists can be created by clicking on the list controls. The font format style and size can be controlled by the list controls as well. If you hit the omega button
you have access to all the special symbols to insert for speech. Normally you need to go to i2speak and copy and paste what you want, in this system we have all the symbols in the system already.
</br>
6)The collapasable boxes are optional boxes. If your report does not use the box leave it blank and it will not 
be included in the final report.</br>
7) If you want to make a check mark its in the special symbols box </br>
8) Electronically sign with your name and license number eg: Jon Sudlow SLP Licence Number 19282828
</br>
9) Click save
</br>
10)If you have not written anything but plan to in the future for a section you can simply place holder
a dash (-) in the box. Be sure to fill it in later!</br>
11) Reports will auto paginate - no more editing reports in 1 place that throw your pagination marks off in word!</br>
12) Reports pull from the patient database and generate a standard header. This is an effort to phase out the custom letter head and standardize the format of SPT reports. </br>
